Prompt
Assignment 1:

You are given a dataset representing the daily temperatures (in Celsius) recorded
in a city over a month. Your task is to perform basic array operations and indexing
using NumPy to analyze the data and extract useful information.

Dataset:

temperatures = [25, 24, 23, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 28, 27, 26, 25, 25, 24, 24, 23, 23,
22, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24]

Tasks:

Convert to NumPy Array:

Convert the given temperatures list to a NumPy array. Array Operations:

Find and print the following: Mean temperature over the month. Maximum temperature recorded.
 Minimum temperature recorded. Standard deviation of the temperatures. Array Indexing and Slicing:

Extract and print the temperatures recorded in the first week of the month (first 7 days).
Extract and print the temperatures recorded in the last 10 days of the month. Find and print
the index of the day with the maximum temperature. Find and print the index of the day with the
 minimum temperature. Data Modification:

Replace the temperatures recorded on the 15th and 20th days with 30Â°C.
